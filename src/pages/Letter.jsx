      Dear Aleena,

      {"\n\n"}I can’t even imagine what university life would’ve been like without you. But one thing I know for sure — our friendship will always stay the same, just like it’s been since the beginning. Please don’t ever change. 🫶🏻

      {"\n\n"}If you weren’t there in uni, I honestly don’t know how I would’ve made it through everything. You’re the kind of friend whose presence makes life easier, lighter, better. Lately, I’ve been scared — scared that maybe after graduation, we won’t get to meet as often. So please, once exams are over, let’s meet up as much as we can. I want to go out with you, make more memories, and soak in every moment we have left. 💕

      {"\n\n"}Having a friend like you means I can handle anything. Your support is something I’ve never felt from anyone else, and I don’t think I ever will. I’m always grateful to you — truly. I pray for you from the bottom of my heart… may Allah always keep you happy, ease your path, and fulfill every wish you hold close.

      {"\n\n"}Whenever you don’t reply for a few days, I don’t get upset — I just hope and pray that you’re doing okay and life is treating you gently. Please take care of yourself, especially now, as things get busier.

      {"\n\n"}Graduation is a big step, a new beginning. And I know you’re going to rock it — wherever you go, whatever you do. You’ve got what it takes, and more. I’m so proud of you.

      {"\n\n"}May Allah guide you, protect you, and bless you in every step ahead.

      {"\n\n"}Always cheering for you,
      {"\n"}Your little moon fragment 🌙
